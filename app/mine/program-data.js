      `We observe inherent sceneries vanish away and urgent attempts
      of agents to revive arrested localities, resulting in temporary
      artifacts and generic affects. These efforts in seeking
      an interim fix only make the absence of any productive transformation
      more profound. What exactly does absence signify?
      Absence could be defined as non-existence or lack of some
      thing. At the same time, absence could also be understood as
      the state of being away from a place or a person. Can absence
      suggest a form of relocation?`,
      `In this workshop, we will investigate the social dynamics
      within the spatial context of the Bremen city center. The focus
      of our exploration is both the pre-existing spatial configurations
      and added artifacts, with particular attention on
      social interactions. To engage with the spatial environment,
      we will seek to enhance auditory and sensory perception with
      the implementation of audio recorders and headphones. Within
      this experimental setting, we will document, map, and archive
      our spatial encounters and experiences as we reflect on the
      meaning of these arrangements regarding social, political,
      and economic dimensions. Following, we will focus on current
      empty commercial spaces. There we will seek the remnants of
      human presence and interactions. Within this context, we will
      explore the notion of the relocated and the consequent reconfigurations
      of social interactions. The first part of the
      session concludes with a group discussion and preparation
      for a biking trip to the Güterverkehrszentrum area of Bremen
      (GVZ).`,
      `The second part of the workshop takes place in GVZ Bremen,
      one of the biggest logistics centers in Germany. Serving as a
      correspondent area to the city center, it converges vast desolate
      sand fields with massive warehouses. Building upon the
      previous framework of practicing enhanced sonic perception,
      we will focus on the exploration of this area and its social
      dynamics as we inform our experimentations with previous experiences
      in the city center. Following questions can be addressed:
      Can warehouses be understood as a symbol of capital
      finance’s triumph? And, in turn, does the city center itself
      represents a site of failure? These explorations serve as a
      point for our exvamination as we devise the narratives of the
      city center and its associate location GVZ Bremen.`

      `Have there always been so many empty shops and spaces in Bremen
      city center? What is the reason behind such radical spatial
      transformation? Are they actually empty or do they still
      contain other kinds of presences? Will they continue to operate
      the same way as before? Answering these and similar
      questions is not simple yet crucial in understating the socio-
      economic state of our cities in order to reorganize the
      collective efforts in creating more accessible social spaces.`,
      `From this point of departure we will have a closer look into
      empty spaces, exploring clues regarding the manifold causes
      of this situation. In the case of commercial city centers,
      various sets of placeholders step forth pointing to potential
      possible futures while simultaneously tracing back to probable
      pasts. A placeholder,then, contradictorily represents
      something that could come after but also holds on to the before.
      This paradoxical site, in its assumed emptiness, becomes
      an interesting object of study and speculation on plausible
      conditions.`,
      `Through studying the proliferation of liminal spaces, ‘Contingent
      Placeholders’ aims to understand the current socio-
      economic state of Bremen’s city center and its shift
      towards the familiar and unknown. The workshop involves situated
      enactment of the participants who are invited to discover
      and interpret the vacant spaces and their possible explanations
      through available placeholders and contextual hints.
      Mentioned processes and their collected interpretations will
      accompany the results from archival research regarding spaces
      and their corresponding historical background.`,
      `Careful guessing via embodied enactments comes together with
      the found data to amplify the paradoxicality (between bodily
      enacted research and scientific/theoretical one) creating a
      foundation for a series of contingent placeholders. Through
      computational methodologies, two sets of findings and hypotheses
      will be combined to regenerate a new set of placeholders
      to speculate on plausible explanations of the inner city’s
      inherent uncertainties.`,
      `To begin we will carryout archival research regarding historical
      background. The following day we will perform an explorative
      drift in the city center and documenting possible
      placeholders. Then we will bring together the two sets of
      collected data in orfer to [re]generate content for the speculative
      placeholders. In the end we will present generated
      images and sounds of contingent placeholding which stems from
      the workshop process.`

      `How does the absence of horizon (horizonlessness) affect our
      perspective on survival?`,
      `Horizonless could be interpreted as something that lacks a
      horizon. In a literal sense, this could describe a situation
      where the horizon is not visible due to obstructions, such as
      fog or tall buildings. Alternatively, “horizonlessness” represents
      a state of mind or circumstance lacking clear boundaries,
      or a sense of confusion, where perspective wanes into
      uncertainty.`,
      `The ‘transient’ UMZU pavilion, once a struggling flower shop,
      holds a unique connotation in the Hanseatenhof in the city
      center of Bremen. Surrounded by multilevel buildings on all
      sides, the shop is secluded from the horizon. By standing at
      the front of the shop, the absence of a visible horizon creates
      feelings of confinement and detachment from the totality
      of the city landscape.`,
      `Exploring the ‘transient’ space, we will delve into how the
      influx of increasing closure of shops may have been influenced
      by the absence of the horizon– ‘horizonless status’
      – which represents a loss of perspective, opportunity, and
      stability. This approach will offer valuable insights into
      the intricate relationship between urban transformations and
      their impact on social disruptions, and overall, survival
      driven migration.`,
      `During the workshop, we will use firsthand knowledge mined
      from archival material about the space. Before the workshop,
      the former flowershop, currently located in Viertel, will be
      contacted,to enrich the content of the workshop. By delving
      into the emotional and economic toll of of losing one’s sense
      of horizon, we will collectively explore themes of migration
      and the quest for survival. In our gathering, we will reflect
      on a time when something big changed in our lives– it could
      be a powerful moment that affected how we saw things.`,
      `Together, we will further delve into how shared visions and
      imaginations can play a crucial role in reclaiming the horizon
      amidst urban shifts. Also, we will seek to reimagine the
      transient space and envision its potential transformation,
      grounded in the concept of ‘communal luxury’.`,
      `Throughout the workshop, we will engage in a series of dynamic
      exercises, physical exploration, readings, and revisits of
      archival material. We will also trace the horizon, engage in
      discussions, and reflect deeply to uncover latent narratives
      and insights from the ‘transient’ space and its surrounding.
      By fostering collaboration and expression among participants,
      we aim to challenge the way we are seeing things and discover
      new pathways for reappropriation in the city.`
